# Opening up and modifying the first model I got from Amazon

As mentioned, the unit is simply screwed together and inside its quite spacious so adding the ESP8266 and mmWave sensor was easy. I used the stacked header pins as the method of attachment and sandwitched the internal nightlight reflector between them:

This worked well for my prototype except for one minor issue which was a single tall capacitor was obstructing things when I tried to reassemble so I simple de-soldered it and replaced it laid over using some angled breakaway header pins, no sweat:

For the prototype I tapped into the 5v right at the USB header which might have seemed obvious but wasn't the easiest place to work and the garbage wire I used made it even more annoying but after some swearing, I got it done:
